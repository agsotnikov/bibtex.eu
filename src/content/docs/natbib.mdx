Managing bibliographic references in LaTeX becomes streamlined and efficient with the `natbib` package. Whether you're working with the traditional `\cite{*}` command or diving deep into advanced citation methods, this guide provides foundational insights to get you started.

## Introduction to `natbib` and Its Strengths

The natbib package extends the capabilities of the standard `\cite{*}` command in LaTeX. It particularly shines in in-text citations with various options and customizations, especially for author-year schemes and displaying textual and parenthetical citations when integrated with BibTeX.

:::tip
Good to know: the package seamlessly works with both author-year and numerical citations and supports the standard bibliography `*.bst` files.

Let's delve into the details of how to harness the power of natbib to format and cite your bibliographic sources.

## Kickstarting Your Journey: Parenthetical and Textual/Narrative In-Text Citations with natbib

Setting up `natbib` requires a similar structure to the standard LaTeX setup. Start by loading the library using `\usepackage{natbib}`. The library offers several configuration options via `\usepackage[options]{natbib}`, discussed in detail below. The primary citation commands in Natbib are `\citet{*}` for textual/narrative citations and `\citep{*}` for parenthetical citations.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{apalike}
\title{A Comprehensive Guide to Reference Management using natbib with BibTeX}
\author{CiteDrive}
\date {January 1988}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
\textbf{Narrative citation:} \citet{Doe:1966} investigated the risks of incorrectly \\
recorded [...], which results in distortion.
\textbf{Parenthetical citation:} The risks of incorrect recording of [...] could lead to distortion
\citep{Doe:1966}.

\medskip

\bibliography{sample}

\end{document}
```

By using `\bibliography{sample}`, you point LaTeX towards your .bib-file, which contains bibliographic entries like:

```bibtex
@article{Doe:1966,
	title        = {Study on the risks of incorrectly recorded [...] and their impact on [...].},
	author       = {John Doe},
	year         = 1966,
	journal      = {BibTeX Publishing},
	volume       = 44,
	number       = 44,
	pages        = {123--456}
}
@article{smith2017,
	title        = {An interesting article},
	author       = {John Smith},
	year         = {2017},
	journal      = {Journal of Interesting Articles}
}
```

For those inclined towards numeric citation styles, here's how you adapt natbib:


```latex
\usepackage[square,numbers]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{abbrvnat}
```

## Deep Dive: Exploring the `cite{*}` Commands in natbib

Understanding the range of `cite{*}` commands provided by `natbib` allows you to cite sources efficiently. This table breaks down their outputs:

| Command (single citation) | Output (author-year) | Output (Numeric) | Command (Multiple citations) | Output (author-year) | Output (Numeric) |
|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------|---|---|
|`\citet{Doe:1966}`|Doe (1966) |Doe [1]|`\citet{Doe:1966,smith2017}`|Doe (1966); Smith (2017)|Doe [1], Smith [2]|
|`\citet[chap.~4]{Doe:1966}`|Doe (1966, chap. 4)|Doe [1, chap. 4]|`\citet[chap.~4]{Doe:1966,smith2017}`|Doe (1966); Smith (2017, chap. 4)|Doe [1], Smith [2, chap. 4]|
|`\citep{Doe:1966}`|(Doe, 1966)|[1]|`\citep{Doe:1966,smith2017}`|(Doe, 1966; Smith, 2017)|[1, 2|
|`\citep[chap.~4]{Doe:1966}`|(Doe, 1966, chap. 4)|[1, chap. 4|`\citep[chap.~4]{Doe:1966,smith2017}`|(Doe, 1966; Smith, 2017, chap. 4)|1, 2, chap. 4]|
|`\citep[see][]{Doe:1966}`|(see Doe, 1966)|[see 1]|`\citep[see][]{Doe:1966,smith2017}`|(see Doe, 1966; Smith, 2017)|[see 1, 2]|
|`\citep[see][chap.~4]{Doe:1966}`|(see Doe, 1966, chap. 4)|[see 1, chap. 4]|`\citep[see][chap.~4]{Doe:1966,smith2017}`|(see Doe, 1966; Smith, 2017, chap. 4)|[see 1, 2, chap. 4]|
|`\citet*{Doe:1966}`|Doe (1966)|Doe [1]|`\citet*{Doe:1966,smith2017}`|Doe (1966); Smith (2017)|Doe [1], Smith [2]|
|`\citep*{Doe:1966}`|(Doe, 1966)|[1]|`\citep*{Doe:1966,smith2017}`|(Doe, 1966; Smith, 2017)|[1, 2]|

Other `natbib` commands, such as `\citealp` and `\citealt`, offer additional flexibility by suppressing brackets. Discover the entire range of commands in the [Reference sheet for natbib usage](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/natnotes2.pdf).
