BibTeX is a reference management system used to format lists of references in a document. It is widely used in academic writing, particularly in scientific and technical fields. In this guide, we will introduce you to the `conference` entry type in BibTeX and show you how to use it in your LaTeX documents.

## The Conference Entry Type

The `conference` entry type is used to refer to papers published in conference proceedings. The required fields for a `conference` entry are:

-   `author`: The name(s) of the author(s) of the paper.
-   `title`: The title of the paper.
-   `booktitle`: The name of the conference proceedings.
-   `year`: The year the conference was held.

Optional fields for a `conference` entry include:

-   `editor`: The name(s) of the editor(s) of the conference proceedings.
-   `volume`: The volume number of the proceedings.
-   `number`: The number of the proceedings.
-   `series`: The name of the series or set of books that the conference proceedings belong to.
-   `pages`: The page numbers on which the paper appears.
-   `address`: The location of the conference.
-   `month`: The month in which the conference was held.
-   `organization`: The organization that sponsored the conference.
-   `publisher`: The publisher of the proceedings.
-   `note`: Miscellaneous information.

Here is an example of a `conference` entry:

```bibtex
@conference{example_conference,
	title        = {The Effects of Climate Change},
	author       = {John Smith and Jane Doe},
	year         = 2022,
	month        = {June},
	booktitle    = {Proceedings of the Annual Conference on Climate Change},
	publisher    = {Springer},
	address      = {Los Angeles, CA},
	pages        = {55--62},
	note         = {This is a sample entry for a paper in conference proceedings.},
	editor       = {Bob Johnson},
	organization = {Climate Change Association}
}

```

## Using the Conference Entry Type in LaTeX

Once you have created a `conference` entry in your BibTeX file, you can reference it in your LaTeX document using the `\cite` command. For example:

```latex
\documentclass{article}  
\begin{document}  
According to \cite{example_conference}, climate change has significant effects on the planet.  
\bibliography{references} 
\bibliographystyle{plain}  
\end{document}
```

In this example, the `example_conference` entry in the `references.bib` file is cited using the `\cite` command. The bibliography is then generated using the `plain` style.
