## Better Bib[La]TeX Overleaf workflow

CiteDrive offers seamless integration with Overleaf as well as BibLaTeX support. You can easily and quickly organize your references without feeling limited by field or type restrictions. No matter if you use BibTeX, BibLaTex, jurabib, or JBibTEX-- we've got you covered!

## Reference, bibliography, and citation management in RStudio (Posit) in Quarto and R Markdown. 

RStudio is now compatible with the 3.0 update, which means you can use BibTeX-first referencing in Quarto and R Markdown. CiteDrive lets you store your references in a different location from your Quarto/R Markdown project, so you can easily and instantly update your bibliography anytime, just like Overleaf.
