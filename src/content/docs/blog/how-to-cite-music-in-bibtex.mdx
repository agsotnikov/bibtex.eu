To cite music in BibTeX, you can use the `@misc` entry type and include the following fields:

-   `author`: The composer or artist who created the music.
-   `title`: The title of the piece of music.
-   `howpublished`: The format in which the music was accessed (e.g. CD, vinyl, online streaming service).
-   `year`: The year the music was published or recorded.

Here is an example of how you might cite a piece of music in BibTeX:

import CiteDrive from '@components/CiteDrive.astro';


<CiteDrive />

```bibtex
@misc{beethoven_symphony_2018,
	title        = {Symphony No. 5 in C Minor},
	author       = {Beethoven, Ludwig van},
	year         = 2018,
	howpublished = {CD}
}
```

If you are citing a specific recording of a piece of music, you may want to use the `@music` entry type instead of `@misc`. This entry type includes additional fields such as `performer` and `publisher` that you can use to provide more specific information about the recording.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
