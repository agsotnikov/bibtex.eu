With natbib, BibTeX is provided with an extension that offers more design freedom for in-text citations, and biblatex is a complete revision of BibTeX that offers more reference types, sorting, and filtering options for bibliographies and localization options. While BibteX is the best-known program, BibLaTex is not only just as robust but also the most recommended program for newcomers. The citation and bibliographical data for references and listings are kept in the so-called .bib-file. It\'s always in the same format:\\n\\n ```latex\\n @article{smith201X,\\n \\ttitle        = {An interesting article},\\n \\tauthor       = {John Smith},\\n \\tyear         = {201X},\\n \\tjournal      = {Journal of Interesting Articles}\\n }\\n ```\\n\\nCiteDrive is not picky about the format; any field and entry type making it work for the bibliographic package of your choice is acceptable. Because CiteDrive\'s fundamental goal is to separate bibliographic data from the document and citation styles, all alternatives are supported by CiteDrive. As a result, we provide three templates below to get you started.\\n\\n### Getting started with BibTeX:\\n\\n### Getting started with natbib:\\n\\n\\n### Getting started with BibLaTeX:"}]}')}}]);
