# Introduction to BibTeX and the Article Type Entry

BibTeX is a reference management system used to format lists of references in a document. It is commonly used in academic writing, particularly in scientific and technical fields. In this guide, we will introduce you to the `article` entry type in BibTeX and show you how to use it in your LaTeX documents.

## The Article Entry Type

The `article` entry type is used to refer to articles published in scholarly journals, magazines, or newspapers. The required fields for an `article` entry are:

-   `author`: The name(s) of the author(s) of the article.
-   `title`: The title of the article.
-   `journal`: The name of the journal, magazine, or newspaper in which the article was published.
-   `year`: The year of publication.

Optional fields for an `article` entry include:

-   `volume`: The volume number of the journal.
-   `number`: The issue number of the journal.
-   `pages`: The page numbers on which the article appears.
-   `month`: The month of publication.
-   `note`: Miscellaneous information.

Here is an example of an `article` entry:


```bibtex
@article{example_article,
	title        = {The Effects of Climate Change},
	author       = {John Smith},
	year         = 2022,
	month        = {January},
	journal      = {Scientific American},
	volume       = 327,
	number       = 1,
	pages        = {44--49},
	note         = {This is a sample entry for an article in a magazine.}
}
```

## Using the Article Entry Type in LaTeX

Once you have created an `article` entry in your BibTeX file, you can reference it in your LaTeX document using the `\cite` command. For example:

```latex
\documentclass{article}  
\begin{document}  According to \cite{example_article}, climate change has significant effects on the planet.  
\bibliography{references}
\bibliographystyle{plain} 
\end{document}
```

In this example, the `example_article` entry in the `references.bib` file is cited using the `\cite` command. The bibliography is then generated using the `plain` style.
