# BibTeX Entry types

BibTeX is a popular bibliographic reference management tool used in the field of computer science and other technical disciplines. It is used to store and manage bibliographic references, such as books, articles, and conference papers, in a structured format. This format can then be used to automatically generate bibliographies in various document formats.

BibTeX has several types of entries, each with its own set of fields, to represent different types of publications. Here is a comprehensive list of all BibTeX types and their fields:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
