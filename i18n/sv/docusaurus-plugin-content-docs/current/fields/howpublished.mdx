# BibTeX field type: howpublished

The `howpublished` field is used with the `@misc` entry, typically as a workaround for a source type BibTeX does not support. The most common example is when citing web pages and specifying a URL.


```tex
@misc{BibTeXeu,
  title = {{Reference management with BibTeX: A short guide},
  howpublished = {\url{https://bibtex.eu/}},
  note = {Accessed: 2022-06-12}
}
