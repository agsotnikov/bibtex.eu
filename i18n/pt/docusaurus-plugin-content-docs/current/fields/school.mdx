# BibTeX field type: school

`school` is specified when a `phdthesis` or `mastersthesis` is cited and is the educational institution where the student wrote the dissertation. This field is required in both entry types.

```tex
@phdthesis{key,
  school={University of ...},
}


@mastersthesis{key,
  series={University of ...},
}
```
