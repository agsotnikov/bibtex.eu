However, keeping track of your references and ensuring that they are formatted correctly can be a challenging and time-consuming task. This is where BibTeX comes in.\\n\\nBibTeX is a typesetting program that is commonly used to manage bibliographic references in LaTeX documents. It was created in the mid-1980s by Oren Patashnik and Leslie Lamport, and since then, it has become one of the most widely used tools for managing references in LaTeX documents.\\n\\nSo, why use BibTeX? Here are a few key benefits:\\n\\n## Consistent Formatting\\n\\nOne of the biggest benefits of using BibTeX is that it ensures that your references are formatted consistently throughout your document. This is especially important if you\'re writing a longer document, such as a thesis or book, where you\'ll be citing many different sources. With BibTeX, you can define your reference styles once and then automatically apply them to all of your references, saving you time and effort.\\n\\n## Automated Processes\\n\\nBibTeX also automates many of the processes involved in managing your references. For example, if you need to add a new reference to your document, you simply add it to your bib-file and then use a command in your LaTeX document to include it. This eliminates the need to manually format each reference, freeing up time and energy that you can use to focus on your research or writing.\\n\\n## Interoperability\\n\\nBibTeX is widely used, which means that it\'s easy to share your bibliographic references with others. For example, you can easily share your bib-file with other researchers who are using LaTeX, making collaboration easier and more efficient. Additionally, there are many tools available that can help you import references from popular databases, such as PubMed or Google Scholar, into your bib-file, making it easy to build up a comprehensive reference library.\\n\\n## Customization\\n\\nFinally, BibTeX is highly customizable, which means that you can create your own reference styles or modify existing ones to suit your needs. This makes it easy to create reference styles that match the specific requirements of your field or publication, ensuring that your references are formatted correctly and meeting the expectations of your audience.\\n\\nIn conclusion, BibTeX is an indispensable tool for anyone who is serious about managing their bibliographic references. Whether you\'re a researcher, academic, or writer, BibTeX can help you save time and effort, ensure consistent formatting, and make collaboration easier and more efficient. If you\'re not already using BibTeX, it\'s definitely worth considering for your next project!"},{"id":"using-biblatex-in-overleaf-with-citedrive-a-comprehensive-guide","metadata":{"permalink":"/da/blog/using-biblatex-in-overleaf-with-citedrive-a-comprehensive-guide","editUrl":"https://github.com/citedrive/bibtex.eu/blog/blog/2023-02-05-overleaf-citations-biblatex copy.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-05-overleaf-citations-biblatex copy.md","title":"Using Biblatex in Overleaf with CiteDrive: A Comprehensive Guide","description":"Overleaf is a popular online platform for writing academic papers and research articles, offering a collaborative and easy-to-use interface for creating, editing, and sharing documents with others.

One of the most important elements of an academic paper is proper citation, and Overleaf offers a number of tools to help you format and manage your references.\\n\\nIn this guide, we\'ll look at how to use Biblatex, a powerful citation management system, to create and format citations in your Overleaf documents.\\n\\n## Step 1: Set Up Biblatex\\n\\nTo get started with Biblatex, you\'ll need to add a few lines of code to your Overleaf document to load the package and configure it to your needs. Here\'s an example of what the preamble of your document might look like:\\n\\n\\n```latex\\n`\\\\usepackage[style=authoryear,backend=biber]{biblatex} \\\\addbibresource{references.bib}`\\n```\\n\\nThis code loads the Biblatex package and sets the citation style to `authoryear`, which is a common citation style used in many academic fields. It also sets the backend to `biber`, which is a robust bibliography processor that can handle complex citation requirements.\\n\\nFinally, the `\\\\addbibresource` command tells Biblatex where to find your bibliographic references, which we\'ll discuss in the next step.\\n\\n## Step 2: Create Your Bibliography\\n\\nBefore you start using Biblatex in Overleaf, you\'ll need to have a bibliographic reference database, commonly known as a bib-file, that contains all the details of your sources. Creating a bib-file can be a time-consuming and tedious task, but with the help of [CiteDrive, a collaborative web-based research management tool](https://citedrive.com/), you can easily create, manage, and share your bibliographic references.\\n\\nCiteDrive is built on BibTeX and fully supports Biblatex, making it a great choice for researchers and academics who want to take advantage of the power and flexibility of these tools. Additionally, CiteDrive connects seamlessly with Overleaf, so you can easily access and edit your bibliographic references right from within your Overleaf documents.\\n\\nTo get started with CiteDrive, simply sign up for a free account and start adding your references. You can import references from popular databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and more, or manually add references to your library. Once you\'ve created your library, you can export it as a BibTeX or Biblatex file, which you can then use in your Overleaf documents.\\n\\nFor more information on how to use CiteDrive with Overleaf, you can refer to the blog post at [https://www.overleaf.com/blog/better-bibliography-management-with-overleaf-citedrive-and-bibtex-biblatex](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/better-bibliography-management-with-overleaf-citedrive-and-bibtex-biblatex).\\n\\nHere\'s an example of a simple reference in Biblatex* format:\\n\\n```bibtex\\n@article{example_reference,   \\n\\tauthor = {John Doe},   \\n\\ttitle = {An Example Article},   \\n\\tjournal = {Journal of Examples},   \\n\\tyear = {2021},   \\n\\tvolume = {1},   \\n\\tpages = {1-10}, \\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can add as many references as you need to this file, and Biblatex will automatically format them according to the citation style you\'ve chosen.\\n\\n## Step 3: Insert Citations in Your Document\\n\\nWith your bibliographic references in place, you can now insert citations into your Overleaf document. To do this, use the `\\\\cite` command followed by the key of your reference. For example:\\n\\n\\n`As demonstrated by Doe (2021), it is possible to use Biblatex with Overleaf.`\\n\\nThe citation will appear in your document as a parenthetical reference, with the author and year of publication, and Biblatex will format it according to the citation style you\'ve chosen.\\n\\n## Step 4: Generate the Bibliography\\n\\nFinally, to generate the bibliography for your document, you\'ll need to add a `\\\\printbibliography` command to the end of your document. This will tell Biblatex to compile the bibliography from your references and format it according to the citation style you\'ve chosen.\\n\\nAnd that\'s it! You\'re now ready to use Biblatex to create and format citations in your Overleaf documents. With its powerful features and flexible configuration options, Biblatex is a great choice for anyone looking for a comprehensive and easy-to-use citation management system."},{"id":"learn-latex-in-1-minute-with-overleaf-and-citedrive","metadata":{"permalink":"/da/blog/learn-latex-in-1-minute-with-overleaf-and-citedrive","editUrl":"https://github.com/citedrive/bibtex.eu/blog/blog/2023-01-28-learn-latex-one-minute.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-28-learn-latex-one-minute.md","title":"Learn LaTeX in 1 Minute with Overleaf and CiteDrive","description":"LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system that is widely used in the academic and scientific communities for creating technical and scientific documents.

In this post, we will discuss how to use citations in Overleaf, a popular online LaTeX editor, with BibTeX, a tool for managing bibliographic references.\\n\\n## Adding a bibliography to your Overleaf project\\n\\nThe first step in using citations in Overleaf is to add a bibliography to your project. This can be done by creating a new file in your project and naming it `references.bib`. This file will contain all of the references that you wish to cite in your document. An alternative option is to use [CiteDrive](https://www.citedrive.com/) which connects to Overleaf and allows you to collaborate on your bibliography and citations. CiteDrive supports BibTeX natively and also Biblatex.\\n\\nTo add a reference to this file, you can use the following format:\\n\\n`@article{key,   author = {Author, A.},   title = {Title},   journal = {Journal},   year = {Year}, }`\\n\\nThe `key` is a unique identifier for the reference and will be used to cite it in your document. The `author`, `title`, `journal`, and `year` fields are required for a basic reference, but there are many other fields that can be included as well.\\n\\n## Citing references in your document\\n\\nOnce you have added your references to the `references.bib` file, you can cite them in your document using the `cite` command. For example, to cite the reference with the key `key`, you would use the following command:\\n\\n`\\\\cite{key}`\\n\\nThis will insert the citation into your document in the format specified by the bibliography style you have chosen.\\n\\n## Formatting your bibliography\\n\\nIn order to format your bibliography, you need to specify a bibliography style. This can be done by including the following command in the preamble of your document:\\n\\n\\n`\\\\bibliographystyle{style}`\\n\\nWhere `style` is the name of the bibliography style you wish to use. Some commonly used styles include `plain`, `unsrt`, and `apalike`.\\n\\nFinally, you need to include the following command at the end of your document to generate the bibliography:\\n\\n\\n`\\\\bibliography{references}`\\n\\nWhere `references` is the name of your bibliography file (`references.bib` in our example).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this post, we have discussed how to use citations in Overleaf with BibTeX. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily add references to your project, cite them in your document, and format your bibliography to meet the requirements of your academic institution or publisher. Additionally, the use of CiteDrive, which connects to Overleaf, allows for easy collaboration on your references and citations. CiteDrive natively supports both BibTeX and Biblatex making it a versatile option for managing your bibliographic references."},{"id":"maximizing-your-writing-potential-the-best-tools-for-collaboration-and-research-on-overleaf","metadata":{"permalink":"/da/blog/maximizing-your-writing-potential-the-best-tools-for-collaboration-and-research-on-overleaf","editUrl":"https://github.com/citedrive/bibtex.eu/blog/blog/2023-01-27-best-tools-overleaf.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-27-best-tools-overleaf.md","title":"Maximizing Your Writing Potential: The Best Tools for Collaboration and Research on Overleaf","description":"Overleaf is a popular online LaTeX and Rich Text collaborative writing and publishing tool that allows you to write, edit, and publish academic papers, articles, and reports.

One of the great features of Overleaf is the ability to easily add citations and bibliographies to your documents using the natbib package. In this post, we will go over the basics of using natbib with Overleaf to add citations and bibliographies to your papers.\\n\\n## Adding Citations\\n\\nTo add citations in Overleaf, you first need to add the natbib package to your document. This can be done by adding the following line to the preamble of your document:\\n\\n`\\\\usepackage[numbers]{natbib}`\\n\\nThis will allow you to use the `\\\\citep` and `\\\\cite` commands to add citations to your document. The `\\\\citep` command is used for in-text citations and will display the citation as a number in parentheses, while the `\\\\cite` command is used for in-text citations and will display the citation as a number.\\n\\nFor example, to cite a paper by Smith et al. (2020) in-text, you would use the following command:\\n\\n`According to \\\\citep{Smith2020}, this is an important finding.`\\n\\nThis will display the citation as:\\n\\n> According to (Smith et al., 2020), this is an important finding.\\n\\n## Adding a Bibliography\\n\\nTo add a bibliography to your document in Overleaf, you first need to create a `.bib` file that contains the information for all of the references that you will be citing. The `.bib` file should be saved in the same directory as your main `.tex` file. One of the easiest ways to create this `.bib` file is by using [CiteDrive](https://citedrive.com/), a tool that connects to Overleaf and generates the bib file for you. More information can be found in the [blog post on Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/better-bibliography-management-with-overleaf-citedrive-and-bibtex-biblatex).\\n\\nOnce you have created your `.bib` file, you can add a bibliography to your document by adding the following command to your document:\\n\\n`\\\\bibliography{mybibfile}`\\n\\nwhere `mybibfile` is the name of your `.bib` file.\\n\\nYou can also specify the style of your bibliography by adding the following command to your document:\\n\\n\\n`\\\\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`\\n\\nThis will format your bibliography in a plain style. There are many different bibliography styles available, and you can find a list of them [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_styles).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this post, we have gone over the basics of using natbib with Overleaf to add citations and bibliographies to your papers. With Overleaf\'s easy-to-use interface and natbib\'s powerful citation and bibliography management capabilities, you can easily keep track of your references and format your bibliography in the style that is required by your publication. Additionally, using CiteDrive to generate the bib file for you can save a lot of time and effort."},{"id":"introduction-to-overleaf-citations","metadata":{"permalink":"/da/blog/introduction-to-overleaf-citations","editUrl":"https://github.com/citedrive/bibtex.eu/blog/blog/2023-01-26-introduction-to-overleaf-citations.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-26-introduction-to-overleaf-citations.md","title":"Introduction to Overleaf Citations ","description":"Proper citation is essential in academic writing for giving credit to the sources you use in your research.

Overleaf is a popular online LaTeX editor that allows users to easily create and collaborate on academic documents. It also includes a number of powerful citation management tools, including BibTeX, NatBib, and BibLaTeX.\\n\\n## Adding Citations\\n\\nTo add a citation in Overleaf, first create a \'.bib\' file with the information about your sources. Each source\'s author, title, publication date, and other pertinent information should be included in this file. You can either create your \'.bib\' file manually or use a tool like [CiteDrifve](https://www.citedrive.com/), a collaborative BibTeX/BibLaTeX-management tool built for the web, to do it for you. **CiteDrive** integrates with Overleaf, keeping all of your references in sync with your LaTeX document.  More information can be found at **Overleaf.com**: \\n[Overleaf.com | Blog - Better bibliography management with Overleaf, CiteDrive, and BibTeX/BibLaTeX \u2014 about 3.0 and an updated guide](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/better-bibliography-management-with-overleaf-citedrive-and-bibtex-biblatex)\\n\\nOnce you have your `.bib` file ready, you can add citations to your Overleaf document by using the `\\\\cite` command. For example, if you want to cite a source with the key `example_source`, you would use the command `\\\\cite{example_source}`.\\n\\nYou can also use the `\\\\citep` and `\\\\citet` commands to specify the formatting of your citations. The `\\\\citep` command is used for in-text citations, and is typically used for referencing a source within parentheses. The `\\\\citet` command is used for author-date citations, and is typically used for referencing a source in the text.\\n\\n## Managing Your Sources\\n\\nOverleaf makes it easy to manage your sources and keep your `.bib` file up-to-date. You can easily add new sources, edit existing ones, and even import and export your `.bib` file to other citation management tools.\\n\\nYou can also use the `\\\\bibliography` command to automatically generate a bibliography at the end of your document. This command takes the name of your `.bib` file as an argument, and will automatically format and organize your sources based on the citation style you choose.\\n\\n## Using the right package\\n\\nThe choice of which package to use for citations in Overleaf will depend on your specific needs and preferences.\\n\\n- **BibTeX** is the most traditional and widely used citation management package for LaTeX. It is simple to use, and supports a wide range of citation styles. However, it does not provide as much flexibility and control over the formatting of citations as the other two options.\\n* ***[natbib](/natbib)** works as an extension for BibTeX, that provides advanced features and flexibility for citation management. It is particularly useful for author-year citation styles, and it allows you to customize the formatting of citations in the text.\\n\\n- **BibLaTeX** is a more modern and powerful alternative to BibTeX. It provides more advanced features such as localization, advanced sorting, and support for more types of entries. Additionally, it can handle all bibliographic data in Unicode and it is compatible with most of the citation styles available in BibTeX.\\n\\nIn summary, if you are looking for a simple and widely supported option, use BibTeX. If you want more control over the formatting and advanced features, use BibLaTeX or natbib.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nCitation management can be a tedious task, but Overleaf makes it easy with its built-in citation tool. With Overleaf, you can easily add, edit, and manage your sources, and automatically generate a bibliography at the end of your document. Whether you\'re a student, researcher, or professional academic, Overleaf is a powerful tool to help you create high-quality, properly-cited documents with ease."},{"id":"how-to-use-grammarly-in-overleaf","metadata":{"permalink":"/da/blog/how-to-use-grammarly-in-overleaf","editUrl":"https://github.com/citedrive/bibtex.eu/blog/blog/2023-01-25-overleaf-grammarly.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-25-overleaf-grammarly.md","title":"How to use Grammarly in Overleaf","description":"Overleaf is a robust LaTeX container with preloaded packages, live collaboration, a cloud-based editor, and a user base of over 10 million.

N\xe5r du har udfyldt din konto, kan du derefter oprette et \\"R-Markdown\\"-projekt (*det virker til Quarto, bare rolig*); du skal blot navngive det og [fylde projektet med referencer](https://citedrive.medium.com/adding-bibliographic-references-to-rstudio-using-citedrive-create-citations-in-r-markdown-or-9b1e1ab59cf6).

For at g\xf8re dette skal du klikke p\xe5 knappen \\"bib\\". Dette vil \xe5bne en ny fane med alle dine poster i BibTeX-format. Kopier URL\'en fra den nye fane og inds\xe6t den i YAML-delen af din QMD-fil.\\n\\n\\n````md\\n---\\nbibliografi: \\"https://api.citedrive.com/bib/514b115a-e8b7-4e14-a7c8-83e88337ad12/references.bib?x=eyJpZCI6ICI1MTRiFTE1YS1lOGI3LTRlMTQtYTdjOC04M2U4ODMzN2FkMTIiLCAidXNlciI6ICI5NzgiLCAic2lnbmF0dXJlIjogIjBkZDgzNGM1NDg2YzE2MTRhYTUzZDAyNmI1YjFhZjgxNTg3ODc4NDQ3Yzk1ODQ1ZWI2ZTA5UTQ5YTFlNDdlMGIifQ==.bib\\"\\n---\\n````\\n\\nDet f\xf8lgende klip viser, hvordan det foreg\xe5r, n\xe5r man bruger R Markdown.

Citing your sources correctly is key to creating a solid argument and avoiding plagiarism. This guide will show you how to cite references on Overleaf using CiteDrive. We\'ll also give you tips for finding reliable sources online. Let\'s get started!\\n\\n\\n\\n## Step 1: Connecting CiteDrive with Overleaf\\n\\nIf you\'re not already signed in to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), you\'ll need to do so now. Then, go to [CiteDrive](https://www.citedrive.com/), create an Overleaf project, and [add references](https://citedrive.medium.com/adding-bibliographic-references-to-overleaf-with-citedrive-325f131e3ca2) to your new project. Your project could look like this:\\n\\n![CiteDrive - Example](@site/static/img/tutorial/citedrive_project_example.png)\\n\\nAfter that, click on \\"bib\\" on the top left of your project. This will open a new tab to the dynamic BibTeX file that you can use for your Overleaf, which will auto-update whenever you or your teammates add, update, or deletes references from your project.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, go to Overleaf, create a new file, select \\"From External URL\\", and paste the URL from the dynamic BibTeX to \\"URL to fetch the file from\\" name it here *references.bib*.\\nYour CiteDrive project is now connected to Overleaf! Remember that you need to click on refresh when you make changes in our CiteDrive project so that Overleaf gets the latest state.\\n\\n![Add files to Overleaf](@site/static/img/tutorial/export_bib_to_overleaf.png)\\n\\n## Step 2: Create a TeX document in Overleaf\\n\\nNow let\'s create a new tex-file for Overleaf, which we could call \\"document.tex\\" we can define the bibliography, the BibTeX file from CiteDrive with `\\\\bibliography{references}`. But what bibliography tools should we use? For Bibliography management in LaTeX/Overleaf, there are many options: most likely, natbib, bibtex, and biblatex. For the management of bibliographies in LaTeX, BibTeX is the mainstay that forms the basis for the format. With natbib, BibTeX is provided with an extension that offers more design freedom for in-text citations, and biblatex is a complete revision of BibTeX that offers more reference types, sorting, and filtering options for bibliographies and localization options. While BibteX is the best-known program, BibLaTex is not only just as robust but also the most recommended program for newcomers. The citation and bibliographical data for references and listings are kept in the so-called .bib-file, just as you see in the BibTeX file from CiteDrive. It\'s always in the same format:\\n\\n ```latex\\n @article{smith201X,\\n \\ttitle        = {An interesting article},\\n \\tauthor       = {John Smith},\\n \\tyear         = {201X},\\n \\tjournal      = {Journal of Interesting Articles}\\n }\\n ```\\n\\n Here `@article` is the source type, `title`, `author`, `year` and `journal`, the attributes used to display in your references lists and citations and lastly, `smith201X`, a unique identifier you can use to reference in your document, mainly with cite(key). CiteDrive is not picky about the format; any field and entry type making it work for the bibliographic package of your choice is acceptable. Because CiteDrive\'s fundamental goal is to separate bibliographic data from the document and citation styles, all alternatives are supported by CiteDrive.\\n\\n\\n As a result, we provide three templates below to get you started.\\n\\n ### Getting started with BibTeX:\\n\\n If you want to start with BibTeX, use the following template or open directly to Overleaf. For more information on BibTeX, see the documentation.\\n\\n ```latex title=\\"document.tex\\"\\n \\\\documentclass{article}\\n \\\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\\n\\n \\\\title{BibTeX references in \\\\LaTeX}\\n \\\\author{John Smith}\\n\\n \\\\begin{document}\\n\\n \\\\maketitle\\n\\n Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent enim urna, dapibus et bibendum vel, consectetur et turpis. Cras a molestie nulla. \\\\cite{Hemingway1952}\\n \\\\medskip\\n\\n \\\\bibliographystyle{unsrt}\\n \\\\bibliography{references}\\n\\n \\\\end{document}\\n ```\\n\\n\\n ### Getting started with natbib:\\n\\n ```latex\\n \\\\documentclass{article}\\n \\\\usepackage{natbib}\\n \\\\bibliographystyle{apalike}\\n \\\\title{A Short Guide to Reference Management using natbib with BibTeX}\\n \\\\author{CiteDrive}\\n \\\\date {January 1988}\\n\\n \\\\begin{document}\\n\\n \\\\maketitle\\n \\\\textbf{Narrative citation:} \\\\citet{Doe:1966} investigated the risks of incorrectly \\\\\\\\\\n recorded [...], which results in distortion.\\n \\\\textbf{Parenthetical citation:} The risks of incorrect recording of [...] could lead to distortion\\n \\\\citep{Doe:1966}.\\n\\n \\\\medskip\\n\\n \\\\bibliography{references}\\n\\n \\\\end{document}\\n\\n ```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n For more on natbib, please click here.\\n\\n ### Getting started with BibLaTeX:\u200b\\n\\n ```latex\\n \\\\documentclass{article}\\n \\\\usepackage{biblatex}\\n \\\\addbibresource{references.bib}\\n\\n \\\\begin{document}\\n Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Cras a molestie nulla. \\\\cite{Hemingway1952}\\n \\\\medskip\\n\\n \\\\printbibliography\\n\\n \\\\end{document}\\n ```\\n\\n\\n\\n For more on BibLaTeX, please click here.\\n\\n\\n\\n ## Step 3: In-Text citations\\n\\n\\n\\n If you have the browser extension installed, you can create citations by selecting the text and clicking on the CiteDrive icon in your toolbar.\\n\\n\\n\\n You can also cite references manually using the cite command. For example, if you wanted to cite Smith (201X), you would use `\\\\cite{smith201X}`. Or use the reference search in overleaf.\\n\\n\\n\\n Bibliography styles are preinstalled on Overleaf and depending which package you used references on the following pages:\\n\\n\\n\\n That\'s it! You should now have everything you need to start using references in Overleaf. Please let us know by e-mail at hello@citedrive.com  if you have any questions or feedback.\\n\\n\\n\\n Happy TeXing!"},{"id":"how-to-convert-a-doi-to-a-bibtex-citation-using-citedrive","metadata":{"permalink":"/da/blog/how-to-convert-a-doi-to-a-bibtex-citation-using-citedrive","editUrl":"https://github.com/citedrive/bibtex.eu/blog/blog/2022-08-12-overleaf-cite.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-12-overleaf-cite.md","title":"How to Convert a DOI to a BibTeX Citation Using CiteDrive","description":"If you\'re a researcher, then you know the importance of bibliographies and citations.
