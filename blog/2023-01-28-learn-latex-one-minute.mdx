# Learn LaTeX in 1 Minute with Overleaf and CiteDrive

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system that is widely used in the academic and scientific communities for creating technical and scientific documents. It uses a markup language to add formatting to text, such as bold, italics, and mathematical symbols. In this post, we will give you a quick overview of what LaTeX is, how to get started with it, and how to make your document creation process even smoother with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and [CiteDrive](https://www.citedrive.com/).

## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system that is used to create professional-looking documents. It is particularly useful for creating technical and scientific documents, such as research papers and theses, as it includes features for creating complex layouts, such as tables and figures.

## Getting Started with LaTeX and Overleaf

To get started with LaTeX, you will need a LaTeX distribution, such as TeX Live or MikTeX, and a text editor, such as TeXworks or Sublime Text. But why settle for just a text editor when you can use Overleaf, the cloud-based LaTeX editor that makes it easy to create, edit, and collaborate on your LaTeX documents.

Here is a simple example of a LaTeX document:

```tex
\documentclass{article} 
	\begin{document} Hello, this is a simple LaTeX document.
\end{document}
```

This is a basic structure of a LaTeX document and it's the starting point of any LaTeX document.
