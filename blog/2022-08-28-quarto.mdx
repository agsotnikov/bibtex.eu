# How to Format Citations and Bibliographies in RStudio with CiteDrive and Quarto


Do you need to format citations and a bibliography for a research paper in RStudio? Are you struggling to keep track of all your references and formatting requirements? Have no fear! CiteDrive and Quarto can help. This blog post will show you how to use both tools to create beautiful, correctly formatted citations and bibliographies.


## Get started

To format citations and bibliographies in RStudio with CiteDrive and Quarto, follow these steps:


### Step 1: Include references in your project

First, you must create a CiteDrive account by going to their website and selecting the 'Sign Up' button. Completing your account will then enable you to make an 'R-Markdown' (*it works for Quarto, don't you worry*) project; simply name it and [fill the project with references](https://citedrive.medium.com/adding-bibliographic-references-to-rstudio-using-citedrive-create-citations-in-r-markdown-or-9b1e1ab59cf6). Yours might look something like this:

### Step 2:  Connect your Quarto document to CiteDrive

Now, let's connect your new CiteDrive to your Quarto document. To do this, click the 'bib' button. This will open up a new tab with all your entries in BibTeX format. Copy the URL from the new tab and paste it into the YAML part of your QMD file.

The following clip shows the flow when using R Markdown. However, the principle of Quarto is the same:

### Step 3: Copy the citation keys.

Once your references are imported, you can insert them into your Quarto document. To do this, return to your CiteDrive project and one or more references your want to insert into your document and click the cite button. CiteDrive will copy the citation key to your clipboard.

Paste your citation key in the necessary passage of your Quarto document.
