The author saves references in plain text files with the extension ",(0,n.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},".bib,")," and each one is assigned a unique key that is used to cite it in the main LaTeX document.

It works with a variety of tools and platforms, including Pandoc for Markdown. Most importantly, you have complete control over the fields and types, allowing you to include any information, notes, etc. without jeopardizing your bibliography.
